  - Git - For version control These commands were used for version control during project:
  - git add . - To add files before committing
  - git commit -m "type your message mentioning changes" - To commit changes to the local repository
  - git push - To push all committed changes to the GitHub repository

  - gspread is a Python API for Google Sheets and requires Python 3+. It allows user to open, read, write, share spreadsheets. Additionally it enables user to select, create, delete worksheets and to format cell ranges.
  - google auth.- This library provides the ability to authenticate to Google APIs using various methods. It also provides integration with several HTTP libraries.
  - pretty table -p print the table in a pretty way.
  - pprint — Data pretty printer — Python 2.7, 3.5 onwards. The pprint module provides “pretty-print” to Python data structures. The formatted representation arranges objects on a single line if it can, and breaks them onto multiple lines if they don’t fit within the allowed width. I used it in order to visualize the lists in more user friendly style.
