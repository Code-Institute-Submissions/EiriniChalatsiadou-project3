## **FEATURES**

- ### **TECHNOLOGIES**

  ### **Languages Used**
  This tool is created using Python language.

  ### **Libraries Used**
  Git - For version control These commands were used for version control during project:
  - git add . - To add files before committing
  - git commit -m "type your message mentioning changes" - To commit changes to the local repository
  - git push - To push all committed changes to the GitHub repository
  - GitHub - To create my repositories, save and store my project files.
  - gspread is a Python API for Google Sheets and requires Python 3+. It allows user to open, read, write, share spreadsheets. Additionally it enables user to select, create, delete worksheets and to format cell ranges.
  - pandas- Python Data Analysis Library pandas is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. It supports Python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 officially. My codes are largely based on pandas code, as they contain extensive functions very well suited for parsing and analysing data.
  - pprint — Data pretty printer — Python 2.7, 3.5 onwards. The pprint module provides “pretty-print” to Python data structures. The formatted representation arranges objects on a single line if it can, and breaks them onto multiple lines if they don’t fit within the allowed width. I used it in order to visualize the lists in more user friendly style.
   Provides
  - numPy provides:
    -  An array object of arbitrary homogeneous items
    - Fast mathematical operations over arrays
    - Linear Algebra, Fourier Transforms, Random Number Generation

 - ### **TESTING**
    - Python Linter Test
 As advised by tutors, I validated Code Institute Python linter. Test result: No errors found. Check in screenshot below.
